# neo4j

The Neo4j driver (bolt) does not natively support executing multiple statements
in a single query. To allow for multiple statements in a single migration, you
can use the `x-multi-statement` param. This mode splits the migration text into
separately-executed statements by a semicolon `;`. Thus `x-multi-statement`
cannot be used when a statement in the migration contains a string with a
semicolon. The queries **should** run in a single transaction, so partial
migrations should not be a concern, but this is untested.

Here are possible connection URLs:

- `neo4j://user:password@host:port/`
- `neo4j+s://user:password@host:port/`
- `neo4j+ssc://user:password@host:port/`
- `bolt://user:password@host:port/`
- `bolt+s://user:password@host:port/`
- `bolt+ssc://user:password@host:port/`
