## Driver Support

### Which go-mssqldb driver to us?

Please note that the deprecated `mssql` driver is not supported. Please use the newer `sqlserver` driver.  
See https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb#deprecated for more information.

### Official Support by migrate

Versions of MS SQL Server 2019 newer than CTP3.1 are not officially supported since there are issues testing against the Docker image.
For more info, see: https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/issues/160#issuecomment-522433269
