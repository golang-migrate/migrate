|------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `x-migrations-table` | `MigrationsTable` | Name of the migrations table |
| `x-migrations-table-quoted` | `MigrationsTableQuoted` | By default, migrate quotes the migration table for SQL injection safety reasons. This option disable quoting and naively checks that you have quoted the migration table name. e.g. `"my_schema"."schema_migrations"` |
| `x-statement-timeout` | `StatementTimeout` | Abort any statement that takes more than the specified number of milliseconds |
| `x-multi-statement` | `MultiStatementEnabled` | Enable multi-statement execution (default: false) |
| `x-multi-statement-max-size` | `MultiStatementMaxSize` | Maximum size of single statement in bytes (default: 10MB) |
| `dbname` | `DatabaseName` | The name of the database to connect to |
| `search_path` | | This variable specifies the order in which schemas are searched when an object is referenced by a simple name with no schema specified. |
| `user` | | The user to sign in as |
| `password` | | The user's password |
| `host` | | The host to connect to. Values that start with / are for unix domain sockets. (default is localhost) |

| `fallback_application_name` | | An application_name to fall back to if one isn't provided. |
| `connect_timeout` | | Maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Zero or not specified means wait indefinitely. |
| `sslcert` | | Cert file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data. |

## Upgrading from v1

1. Write down the current migration version from schema_migrations
1. `DROP TABLE schema_migrations`
2. Wrap your existing migrations in transactions ([BEGIN/COMMIT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/transaction-iso.html)) if you use multiple statements within one migration.
3. Download and install the latest migrate version.
4. Force the current migration version with `migrate force <current_version>`.

## Multi-statement mode

In PostgreSQL running multiple SQL statements in one `Exec` executes them inside a transaction. Sometimes this
behavior is not desirable because some statements can be only run outside of transaction (e.g.
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`). If you want to use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` without activating multi-statement mode
you have to put such statements in a separate migration files.
