## Reporting a Vulnerability

For a [full disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_(computer_security)), create a GitHub issue.

For a [coordinated disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure), email golangmigrate@proton.me and then create a GitHub issue notifying the maintainers that there's a new vulnerability (without the details).
We won't be checking that email address regularly so it's important to also create a GitHub issue to notify us.

Please suggest potential impact and urgency in your reports.
