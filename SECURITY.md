## Reporting a Vulnerability

We prefer [coordinated disclosures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure). To start one, create a GitHub security advisory following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)

Please suggest potential impact and urgency in your reports.
